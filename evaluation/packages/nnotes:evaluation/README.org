*** Definitions

** Init State
   - Learners pratice on a note by selecting an idea and doing corresponding 
     exercises.

** Problem
   - Learners can't easily practise on whole note.
     - They have to manually select ideas and practise on these ideas.
   - Learners don't have a global performance report.
   
** End State
   - Given a note, a learner can:
     - access an ordered list of all exercises
     - try to complete these exercises
     - get a report that shows:
       - what he knows : areas where the learner is good at
       - what he doesn't know : areas that still need to be improved

   note 
   -> ordered list of exercises
   -> data := [(note section, # of exercises completed, # of section exercises)]
   -> report

*** Rationale
    - Only solution found so far
