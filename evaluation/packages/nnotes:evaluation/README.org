*** Definitions

** Init State
   - Learners pratise on a note by selecting an idea and doing corresponding 
     exercises.

** Problem
   - Learners have to manually select ideas and practise on these ideas.
   - They can't practise on whole note.
   
** End State
   - Learners can practise on a whole note by doing all exercises related to 
     this note:
     - a learner select a note to work on
     - he then goes on "evaluation" page where he can find a list of all
       exercises from that note
     - after answering exercises, a report is showed and learners have a global 
       view on what they know and don't know

*** Rationale
    - Only solution found so far
